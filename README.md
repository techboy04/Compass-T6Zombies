# Compass
Another day, another random script

I wanted to make a compass (inspiration from Cold War)
The compass shows only the horizonal angle, the direction facing (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest), and the area you are currently in.

The compass is aligned to the middle of the top and its small enough to not feel like its in the way of playing. 

## Installation
Download compass.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using compass_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice

##Configuration
This script is configurable

```set value 0/1```
enable_direction - Display the direction the player is facing - Default: 1
enable_zone = Displays the zone the player is in - Default: 1
enable_angle = Displays the angle the player is facing - Default: 1
